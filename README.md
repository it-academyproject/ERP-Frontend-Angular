    git config –-global user.email <yourGitHubEmail>

## INSTALLATION

---

> 1.  Clone the repo from remote to local:

    git clone <repoURL>

> 2.  Access that folder in local. If you're using your terminal or console, type:  
>      `cd <localProjectFolderName>`
>
>         IMPORTANT! Be sure you are inside the <localProjectFolderName> folder

> 3.  Remember to download all `node-modules` **dependecies** as defined in the `package.json` file.  
>     To do so, jut type in the following command in your terminal:

    npm update

>         REMEMBER! Never push node-modules to GitHub, since the folder is too big sized
>
> **node-modules** are already excluded in the `.gitignore` file. Never modify that line!

## WORKING WITH BRANCHES

---

> - This project has 2 branches (`main` and `Dev`), which should NOT be manipulated by any developer.  
>   That role is restricted to project managers, who will accept or reject developer's `pull requests`.

> - Use the following semantics for naming your branches: `<ScrumTask_ID>` or optionally `<ScrumTask_ID-featureBranchName>`.  
>   For example: _F1.4 or F1.4_LoginView_

> - And don't forget to create your `feature` branches from `Dev`.  
>   To do so:
>
> 1.  Pull actual **Dev** branch state:

    git pull origin Dev

> 2.  Create your **feature** branch:

    git checkout -b <featureBranchName>

> 3.  Work on your branch. Do your `add-to-stage` and `commits`

> 4.  Pull **Dev** branch state again:

    git pull origin Dev

> 5.  Push your **branch** to the repo:

    git push origin <featureBranchName>

> 6.  Finally, do a `pull request` in `GitHub`, from your **branch** to **Dev**

## ANGULAR CLI COMMANDS

---

> - Open development server:

    ng serve -o

> - Restart development server:

    ng serve

> - Run Kharma test runner:

> - Run test coverage to add the coverage folder to the project.  
>   Then open its **index.html** in browser to see the coverage view
